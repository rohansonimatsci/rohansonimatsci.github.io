## Low Temperature Laboratory
### Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati
#### Research Assistant
_Aug. 2016 to Jun. 2017_

Ascertained electronic and structural effects of NiO doping in Alkaline Niobates for use in new generation capacitors. Prepared bulk ceramic samples via powder synthesis and sol-gel methods, including heat treatments. Conducted dielectric spectroscopy, XRD, TGA, Raman spectroscopy, and FESEM to characterize the doped ceramics.

Our work was published in in the [Journal of Applied Physics](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/aa82f6) & 3 conferences, won Best poster award (Research Conclave, IITG, 2017)
