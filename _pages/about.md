I'm a `PhD Candidate` in Materials Science at the `Boston University` College of Engineering. I studied Physics at the `Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati` as an undergraduate.

I'll be at the [12th International Conference on the Science of Hard Materials ICSHM12](https://www.icshm12.org/), March 11-15 2024, come say Hi!

I'm presenting our work on [Effect of process parameters on the growth of AlN coatings on Al-based alloy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897223010290) at `Session 3: Coatings` on Monday, March 11th.
