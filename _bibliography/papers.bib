abstract = {We report a detailed study on structural and dielectric properties, Raman scattering, and ac-conductivity of ferroelectric KNbO3 and antiferromagnetic NiO two-phase composites [() KNbO3  +  x NiO]. Two major transitions were observed in the temperature dependent relative dielectric permittivity (T)—the first at C () and the second at C (T1)—respectively associated with the structural transitions from tetragonal to cubic and orthorhombic to tetragonal phases. In addition, a new anomaly across T2  ∼  C has been observed in (T), and the loss-tangent (Tanδ(T)), which may be associated with the combined effect of antiferromagnetic ordering of NiO and ferroelectric coupling of KNbO3. The dispersive nature of , and the Vogel–Fulcher temperature dependence of its characteristic relaxation frequency reveals the existence of relaxor-like behavior, which is further supported by Uchino–Nomura criteria (for x  ⩽  ) but departs from relaxor behavior for x  . Temperature dependent ac-resistivity analysis (T) provides strong evidence for a Mott’s Variable range hopping process of charge carriers between localized states, with average hopping length of  nm and hopping energy  eV. The variation of , T1 and T2 as a function of x, in consonance with the crystal structure, has been discussed. Raman spectroscopic studies were carried out to study the local structure of the ()   +  x NiO two-phase composites, which shows significant increase of tilt-angle between adjacent  octahedra as the divalent Ni occupies octahedral sites of the  matrix. All the Raman-active modes of these composites are indexed as lattice translations, specifically with the motion of  (190 ), the core vibrations of the  octahedra (220   ⩽  ν  ⩽  320 ) and their collective modes (50   ⩽  ν  ⩽  150 ), and Magnon modes (2M  ∼  1500 ) associated with the antiferromagnetic ordering of NiO.}

abstract = {The objective of the study was to grow uniform nitride coatings over Al-6061 alloys to resist fluorine diffusion. This paper discusses a process of carrying out surface nitridation of an Al-6061 alloy substrate. Through this method, a dense aluminum nitride coating can be grown on Al-6061 alloy with complete area coverage of the samples having complex geometries. The method uses nitrogen gas alone as the nitrogen carrier, and not ammonia derivatives used in conventional processes. Magnesium powder was also used in the process to reduce the protective alumina layer on the alloy and to facilitate the aluminum nitride growth. The process led to uniform coating coverage over the flat sample surfaces as well as over the surfaces of drilled holes in the sample. The coatings were stable when subjected to several 400 °C thermal cycles.},
